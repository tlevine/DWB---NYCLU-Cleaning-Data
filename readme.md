This folder contains the appended 2007-2010 data in a hopefully slightly smaller form with some of the variables left out, saved as "data.csv" or "data.RData". 

The same data set with the crime suspected, crime of arrest, and summons crime is "all.csv", "all.RData".

Additional variables that were removed can be merged back in by rownum and year from the [year]merged.csv data sets.

The key to the recoded variables is the "key" pdf.

The GenerateData R file should generate the data I have in the folder from the data available for download on the NYCPD website.
